# Eisenhower Matrix Task Prioritizer in C++

This project implements a command-line tool that organizes tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix model. It classifies tasks into four quadrants based on urgency and importance, then prints a clean matrix and generates a recommended execution order using a priority queue.

## Features
- Takes task input from the user.
- Categorizes each task into:
  1. Important and Urgent
  2. Not Important and Urgent
  3. Important and Not Urgent
  4. Not Important and Not Urgent
- Displays the full Eisenhower Matrix in a formatted table.
- Generates an automated priority order using a max priority queue.
- Supports flexible input through the terminal or an `input.txt` file.
